-- Fix RLS policies to work with custom authentication
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor

-- First, let's disable RLS temporarily to test if that's the issue
ALTER TABLE lessons DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE sections DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE courses DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Also disable RLS on user_progress since we're using custom auth
ALTER TABLE user_progress DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Verify the current state
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE tablename IN ('lessons', 'sections', 'courses', 'user_progress')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Test if we can now delete lessons
-- (This will be handled by the application, but we can verify the table is accessible)
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_lessons FROM lessons;
